# tetrahedron-in-sphere

Imagine a hollow sphere at the center of the coordinate frame (0,0,0) . 
The walls of the sphere are rigid. The insides of the sphere contains a diamond that is made of triangles, which is constantly trying to escape from the sphere, but bounces back again and again (randomly). These objects are rotating(randomly) and moving(randomly) within the boundary of the sphere. 

My solution in this project makes use of GLUT and openGL.


### Here are some things you can do with the object:
- If you left-click on the output window, the object stops at the current position, and on left-clicking again it resumes.
- If you left-click and stop the object, and then press "t" on your keyboard, the object translates to a random position inside the sphere.
- If you left-click and stop the object, and then press "s" on your keyboard, the object gets scaled in size.
